# Search-system-with-PDO-MVC

This project is a search system developed using Core PHP, PDO (PHP Data Objects) for database interaction, and a custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It leverages MySQL for data storage and utilizes jQuery and AJAX calls for enhanced dynamic functionality.

>> Key Components:
1. Core PHP: Implemented using a custom MVC structure and PDO for secure database communication.
2. MySQL Database: Used for storing and managing search data.
3. jQuery and AJAX: Used to handle dynamic client-side functionality and asynchronous data fetching.

>> Steps to Set Up:

1. Import Database: Import the provided database file into your MySQL server.
2. Deploy the Project: Place the `phpsearch` folder in your serverâ€™s `htdocs`, `www`, or equivalent directory, or any desired production directory.

>> Key Features:

1. MVC Architecture: Demonstrates the use of the MVC design pattern in PHP for clean and organized code with clear separation of concerns.
2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implements OOP principles for better code maintainability and scalability.
3. Secure Database Queries: Utilizes PDO for writing secure database queries, preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. Enhanced Security: Ensures URL requests and form submissions are secure, offering an additional layer of protection against CSRF attacks.
5. Lightweight and Easy to Use: This system is compact and simple to understand, making it ideal for quick implementation in any project.

>> Overview:
This search system is built with PHP, PDO, and MVC architecture, providing a robust and efficient solution for adding search functionality to web projects. Its lightweight nature and clean structure make it easy to integrate and customize, while its focus on security ensures safe interactions with the database and user inputs.
